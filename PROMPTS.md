# AI Prompts

This document records the prompts used during the development of CloudHelpAI for reference and documentation purposes.

## Prompt 1: Initial README Reformatting Request

I need help reformatting my README file for my CloudHelpAI project because the current README lacks proper structure and formatting, and I want it to have bold section titles for better readability, clear deployment links for both frontend and backend, the GitHub repository link prominently displayed, proper markdown formatting with code blocks, comprehensive installation and deployment instructions, and a professional structure that showcases the project well.


## Prompt 2: Routing Issues

Can you tell me why the routing is not working, because when I try to access my Cloudflare Worker API endpoint I'm getting 404 errors or the requests aren't reaching the right handler, and the frontend can't connect to the backend properly, so I need to understand what's wrong with my routing configuration and how to fix the connection between my frontend and the API endpoint. I have tried several ways but it's not working well.


## Prompt 3: CSS Design Improvements

This CSS is pretty good but, can you give me ideas to make a better design, because the current interface looks a bit plain and doesn't have a modern feel, and I want something more visually appealing with better user experience, including modern gradients, smooth animations, better color schemes.

## Prompt 4: Automatic Deployment Not Working

My app is not automatically deploying so tell me why, because I pushed my code to GitHub but Cloudflare Pages isn't picking up the changes and deploying them automatically like it should, and I need to understand what configuration or settings I'm missing to enable automatic deployments whenever I push new commits to my repository.
